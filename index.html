  <p data-view-type="live">There is a crucial interrelation between microstructure and chemical, physical, and/or mechanical properties of materials.</p>
  <p data-view-type="course">Digital imaging techniques are becoming a fast growing method for microstructural characterization. Since there is a crucial interrelation between the microstructure and the chemical, physical, and/or mechanical properties of a material, one is obliged to examine them well, if one wants to understand the macroscopical features of a material.</p>
  <p data-view-type="course">There are three aspects of microstructural characterization:</p>

    <p data-view-type="live">Microscopy: allows looking at objects not visible for the naked eye.</p>
    <p data-view-type="live">Limitation: the smallest distinguishable features are determined by the wavelength of visual light (0.4 - 0.7 Î¼m)</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">Microscopy has always been an intriguing area of science, since it allows looking at objects in a way which is beyond the possibilities of the naked eye. From the end of the 16th century, optical lenses were used to magnify objects more than a hundredfold, which opened a whole new world to scientists of all fields. Although modern optical microscopes make it possible to look at matter at the microscopic scale, there is also a limit. The smallest distinguishable features are determined by the wavelength of visual light (Â±0.4 - 0.7 Î¼m), due to the fact that even a microscope with perfect lenses is subjected to diffractive effects. However, by changing the source of illumination to a radiation probe with a smaller wavelength, smaller details can be observed.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">In electron microscopes, a high voltage is used to accelerate electrons emitted from a heated filament, which can then be focused using magnetic lenses onto a sample. The resolution in these devices is limited by the lenses.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">One issue which is common to both microscopic techniques is the need for sample preparation. Because of the limited penetrating power of both visible light and electrons, thin slices of the sample have to be produced to investigate the sample in transmission (the amount of transmission through the sample gives information about the composition). It is also possible to study objects by detecting reflected light/particles, but even then some kind of sample preparation (like polishing) is often needed. In both modes, no true 3D information can be obtained (only slices or surfaces are visualised). Furthermore, these methods are often destructive, making it impossible to perform other analytical techniques on the same sample afterwards.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">X-rays are an alternative probe to study small objects. As can be seen in Figure 1, X-rays typically have a wavelength below 10 nm, which means that in practice the resolution is limited because of other reasons (focusing devices). Another important fact about X-rays is that they are attenuated less easily than electrons and visible light. More importantly, their penetrating power is largely dependent on their energy (which is directly related to their wavelength), making it possible to adjust the energy of the source to the type of sample under investigation (based on size, composition,...).</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">During this course, several techniques including the analysis of digital thin sections (largely based on the book of John Russ âThe imaging processing handbookâ) obtained by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy techniques, X-ray CT, neutron CT and XRF will be discussed.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">A high quality petrographical microscope can usefully magnify up to 600 times with a maximum resolution of around 1 Âµm. Where closer examination is required, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is invaluable as it achieves significantly higher magnifications up to 50.000 times and resolutions of around 7 nm, by using a beam of high-energy electrons to replace the light of conventional microscopes. In addition to their high-resolution capabilities, electron microscopes have great depth of field, producing electron images that have a 3D effect. By combining SEM with an electron probe microanalysis system (EPM) elemental chemical analysis of characteristic X-ray spectra emitted by the sample can be performed. By performing âspotâ analysis on selected points of the sample, a semi-quantitative elemental analysis can be performed, while âelemental mappingâ scans along a square line raster over a larger area of the sample surface allow the observation of variations in elemental distributions.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">Mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) can also be useful for identification of crystalline minerals when the optical properties do not allow definitive microscopical identification. XRD (which is not in the scope of this course) has the advantage of actually identifying the minerals present, although estimation of the relative amounts is semi-quantitative. Other spectroscopic analysis methods such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF), atomic absorption (AAS), and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) give very precise determinations of elemental composition. However, the elemental composition data from these techniques require skilled interpretation by the analyst to identify the proportions of mineral phases present.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is the emission of characteristic "secondary" (or fluorescent) X-rays from a material that has been excited by bombarding with high-energy X-rays or gamma rays. The phenomenon is widely used for chemical analysis. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements employing the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state. In analytical chemistry, the technique is used for determining the concentration of a particular element in a sample to be analyzed. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), also referred to as inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), is an analytical technique used for the detection of trace metals. It is a type of emission spectroscopy that uses the inductively coupled plasma to produce excited atoms and ions that emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths characteristic of a particular element (StefÃ¡nsson et al., 2007). The intensity of this emission is indicative of the concentration of the element within the sample.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">High-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT) or micro-CT (ÂµCT) is a frequently used non-destructive 3D imaging and analysis technique for the investigation of internal structures of a large variety of objects, including geomaterials. One of the main advantages of this technique is the fact that it is a non-destructive characterization technique which allows 4D monitoring of internal structural changes at resolutions down to a few hundred nanometres. X-ray CT, just like XRF, can be performed both in laboratory environment or at synchrotron facilities. Neutron CT is a form of computed tomography involving the production of three-dimensional images by the detection of the absorbance of neutrons produced by a neutron source. It creates a three-dimensional image of an object by combining multiple planar images with a known separation just like X-ray CT. Whilst its resolution is lower than that of X-ray tomography, it can be useful for specimens containing low contrast between the matrix and object of interest; for instance, fossils with a high carbon content, such as plants or vertebrate remains or water inside stone. However, neutron tomography can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving imaged samples radioactive.</p>

  <p data-view-type="course">Each pixel is assigned a tonal value (black, white, shades of gray or colour), which is represented in binary code (zeros and ones) (fig. 1). The binary digits ("bits") for each pixel are stored in a sequence by a computer and often reduced to a mathematical representation (compressed). The bits are then interpreted and read by the computer to produce an analog version for display or printing.</p></div>

  <p data-view-type="course">RESOLUTION is the ability to distinguish fine spatial detail. The spatial frequency at which a digital image is sampled (the sampling frequency) is often a good indicator of resolution. This is why dots-per-inch (dpi) or pixels-per-inch (ppi) are common and synonymous terms used to express resolution for digital images (fig. 3). Generally, but within limits, increasing the sampling frequency also helps to increase resolution; the more pixels are present in a given area, the higher the resolution of the image.</p></div>

    <p data-view-type="course">Resolution is perhaps the most important parameter in 3D imaging techniques, as well as for for example, the selection of the camera. Images must be able to record the fine detail revealed by the microscope magnification. Resolution is also often quoted as the size of charged coupled device (CCD), which is effectively the number of pixels on the chip. It should be noted, however, that the size of the individual pixels varies amongst different types of CCDs. For microscopy, a pixel size (square) of 6.7 micrometres is thought to be ideal. Increasing resolution enables the capture of finer detail. At some point, however, added resolution will not result in an appreciable gain in image quality, only larger file size. The key is to determine the resolution necessary to capture all significant detail present in the source document.</p>

With 2 bytes per pixel (65,536 values) each bit represents about 0,15 m and the map can distinguish the curbs along most streets. With 4 bytes per pixel (4 billion values) each bit corresponds to less than 200 Î¼m, and the roughness of sand on a beach can be recorded.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">DYNAMIC RANGE is the range of tonal difference between the lightest light and darkest dark of an image (Fig. 8). The higher the dynamic range, the more potential shades can be represented, although the dynamic range does not automatically correlate to the number of tones reproduced. For instance, high-contrast microfilm exhibits a broad dynamic range, but renders few tones. Dynamic range also describes a digital system's ability to reproduce tonal information. This capability is most important for continuous-tone documents that exhibit smoothly varying tones, and for photographs it may be the single most important aspect of image quality.</p>

The file size for digital images can be quite large, taxing the computing and networking capabilities of many systems. All compression techniques abbreviate the string of binary code in an uncompressed image to a form of mathematical shorthand, based on complex algorithms. There are standard and proprietary compression techniques available. In general it is better to utilize a standard and broadly supported one, than a proprietary one that may offer more efficient compression and/or better quality, but which may not lend itself to long-term use or digital preservation strategies.</p>

    </ul>
    <p data-view-type="course">Compression schemes can be further characterized as either lossless or lossy. Lossless schemes abbreviate the binary code without discarding any information, so that when the image is "decompressed" it is bit for bit identical to the original. Lossy schemes (Fig. 9), such as JPEG, utilize a means for averaging or discarding the least significant information, based on an understanding of visual perception. However, it may be extremely difficult to detect the effects of lossy compression, and the image may be considered "visually lossless." Lossless compression is most often used with bitonal scanning of textual material. Lossy compression is typically used with tonal images, and in particular continuous tone images where merely abbreviating the information will not result in any appreciable file savings.</p>

    <h2 data-view-type="live">Spatial calibration</h2>
    <p data-view-type="live">= process of assigning the number of pixels per unit length to an image</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">CALIBRATION: With computer analysis of digital images taken at the microscope, the images are represented in the form of picture elements, or pixels, which are small dots making up the image. In order to perform measurements, the image analysis tools need to know how many pixels there are in one unit length of the image. The unit length may be in millimeters, micrometers, or any other unit chosen according to the overall size of the image and its important components. The process of assigning the number of pixels per unit length to an image is known as calibration. Before undertaking any analysis, a system setup must be calibrated so that measurements such as length, perimeter, or area are calculated in a specific unit, rather than as number of pixels measured (Reedy and Kamboj 2004). The calibration for each setup depends on the magnification of the objective lens that is used to view the image under the microscope, the resolution under which the image is stored, and the digital camera/microscope combination that is being used to acquire the image. This calibration measure will then apply to all images taken with that combination. The appropriate calibration measure must be imported and applied to each image at the time of analysis, so it is crucial to store that information on the image itself, in the filename, or in an image database. Most digital microscope cameras include the capability of marking each image directly at the time of image capture with a scale bar. Where this was not done, a scale bar can be inserted after the fact with most image analysis software packages. It is important to include the scale bar in published reports rather than listing a magnification. Calculated magnifications apply to what the eye sees when looking into the microscope lens. In traditional work, magnifications had to be recalculated to adjust for publication size of photomicrographs. In image analysis work there are also many intermediate steps in which the digital image may be resized, which also would affect magnification. The original image as viewed under the microscope can be thought of as a rubber band being extended or contracted during photography, analysis, and final publication, making magnifications impossible to track. Thus most journals require scale bars in thin-section images, but do not list magnifications.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">IMAGE ENHANCEMENT OR PREPROCESSING: It is often necessary to enhance features of interest in order to perform an analysis. When a new project is initiated, identifying a reliable protocol for enhancement may be somewhat time-consuming. Once done, however, the same procedure can be applied routinely to similar materials undergoing the same analysis, and often routines can be set up to perform image enhancement or preprocessing steps automatically. One often needs to separate two or more different particle types, phases, or components, and then count or measure specific features of one or both populations. Before any measurement and analysis can be done, particles must be clearly visible, with high contrast between particles and matrix or between the components of interest. There are a variety of approaches to preprocessing to correct potential problems. For example, image contrast and brightness can be manipulated to emphasize particular features, and various algorithms can be applied such as an edge enhancement filter that highlights all edges and ignores particle masses (Schmitt 1993; Goins and Reedy 2000). Most comprehensive image analysis packages include all tools needed for preprocessing. For many thin sections, contrast enhancement is sufficient to improve the image enough for successful analysis. Some initial experimentation will help identify optimal preprocessing procedures for the material under study and the goals of the analysis.</p>
